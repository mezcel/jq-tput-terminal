Termainal Rosary using Jq and Bash

About:

This is an app which runs within a command line terminal GUI. Text content is provided by a json db which I ported in from my [Electron Rosary App](https://github.com/mezcel/electron-container), as text content.

* JQ is a cross-platform C program which parses json script via command line terminal
* tput is a tool for mormatting text display in a comman line terminal
* Bash is a comman line terminal shell interface commonly associated with Unix derived OS's

# source scripts

I broke down my 'bash app' into modular source scripts

The scripts mostly contain script sequences bundled into "function variables" 

### Load sequence

```ui-appearance.txt```
```jq-parsing.txt```
```paschal-full-moon.txt```
```tput-formatting.txt```
```webscrapeing.txt```
```dialog-whiptail.txt```
```keyboard.txt```

### Loads source script sequence into the Bash environment Session

```initialize-sources.txt```

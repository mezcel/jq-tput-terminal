people,<br>the priests, the captain of the temple guard,<br>and the Sadducees confronted them,<br>disturbed that they were teaching the people<br>and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection of the dead.<br>They laid hands on Peter and John<br>and put them in custody until the next day,<br>since it was already evening.<br>But many of those who heard the word came to believe<br>and the number of men grew to about five thousand.<br><br>On the next day, their leaders, elders, and scribes<br>were assembled in Jerusalem, with Annas the high priest,<br>Caiaphas, John, Alexander,<br>and all who were of the high-priestly class.<br>They brought them into their presence and questioned them,<br>"By what power or by what name have you done this?"<br>Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, answered them,<br>"Leaders of the people and elders:<br>If we are being examined today<br>about a good deed done to a cripple,<br>namely, by what means he was saved,<br>then all of you and all the people of Israel should know<br>that it was in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazorean<br>whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead;<br>in his name this man stands before you healed.<br>He is <em>the stone rejected by you, the builders,<br>which has become the cornerstone.</em><br>There is no salvation through anyone else,<br>nor is there any other name under heaven<br>given to the human race by which we are to be saved."<br> </div> </div></div></div><div id="cs_control_228452" class="cs_control CS_Element_Textblock"><div class="CS_Textblock_Text"><div class="bibleReadingsWrapper">

Sea of Tiberias.<br>He revealed himself in this way.<br>Together were Simon Peter, Thomas called Didymus,<br>Nathanael from Cana in Galilee,<br>Zebedee's sons, and two others of his disciples.<br>Simon Peter said to them, "I am going fishing."<br>They said to him, "We also will come with you."<br>So they went out and got into the boat,<br>but that night they caught nothing.<br>When it was already dawn, Jesus was standing on the shore;<br>but the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus.<br>Jesus said to them, "Children, have you caught anything to eat?"<br>They answered him, "No."<br>So he said to them, "Cast the net over the right side of the boat<br>and you will find something."<br>So they cast it, and were not able to pull it in<br>because of the number of fish.<br>So the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, "It is the Lord."<br>When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord,<br>he tucked in his garment, for he was lightly clad,<br>and jumped into the sea.<br>The other disciples came in the boat,<br>for they were not far from shore, only about a hundred yards,<br>dragging the net with the fish.<br>When they climbed out on shore,<br>they saw a charcoal fire with fish on it and bread.<br>Jesus said to them, "Bring some of the fish you just caught."<br>So Simon Peter went over and dragged the net ashore<br>full of one hundred fifty-three large fish.<br>Even though there were so many, the net was not torn.<br>Jesus said to them, "Come, have breakfast."<br>And none of the disciples dared to ask him, "Who are you?"<br>because they realized it was the Lord.<br>Jesus came over and took the bread and gave it to them,<br>and in like manner the fish.<br>This was now the third time Jesus was revealed to his disciples<br>after being raised from the dead.<br><br><br><br> </div> </div></div></div>

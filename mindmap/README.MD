## Program Organization

I made a mindmap of the BASH source files. [FreeMind](https://sourceforge.net/projects/freemind/)

It is a taxonomy of where all the different script calls are derived from.

My dev mindset: run sequential bash script sequence

## Mindmap (used for debug backtracking)

Used mostly for debugging. Months from now, I will not remember what I did, and I want a way to make edits without relearning what/why/how things are doing what it does.

# Daily Readings

Daily Mass Readings from USCB Website ```http://www.usccb.org```

This is a tempory dir which holds a parsed html text file. I use Elinks to neatly display the html formatted text.

It is possible to view daily readings directly from the web, but the local file I generated is easier to read and the file contains only the required text needed without the bloat.

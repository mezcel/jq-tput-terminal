# To-Do

1. Breakdown .bash into many source files

2. instead of session storage var, use a text file to hold all my blobals
	* you can make a private and a public file this way

	chomod
    execute rights for all (a+x or +x, as a is the default),
    read rights for all (a+r or +r, as a is again the default),
    write permissions just for you (u=w)


3. Go back and figure out the nested while loop dilema
